* Unreleased

** Changes

+ Use a functional paradigm for internal functions that mutate the org AST. That is, only change the buffer after all changes have been decided and the initial parse tree has been modified to introduce those changes.
+ New command: ~org-keyterm-index-update-headline-at-point~

* 0.1.0 --- 2025-05-13

** Fixes

+ When the ~org-keyterm-index-property-value-name~ property is set in a headline, insert a new keyterm index drawer at the end of this headline.

** Changes

+ Use [[https://github.com/ndwarshuis/org-ml][org-ml]] instead of using org-element.el alongside manual modifications of the buffer with ~insert~, ~replace-buffer-contents~, and the like.

* 0.0.1 --- 2025-05-12

+ Introduce ~org-keyterm-index-update-buffer~ and basic user options.
